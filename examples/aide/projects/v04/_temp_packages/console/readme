A lot of example programs by Mike Feldman use a basic ANSI based SCREEN
package. For reasons best known to themselves, Microsoft decided not to
implement the ANSI interfaces for Windows (Win32) console programs.

This archive contains a version of the SCREEN package that will work on
Windows. It is suitable for both GNAT and ObjectAda.

To try it out, build (gnatmake) the smiley program.

Have fun!
Jerry.
