How to compile the programs using the GNAT compiler.

    * Compile the library file Simple_io.ads
      gnatchop -w -r simpleio.ads
      If you are using DOS/Win 3.1 then use the -k flag to truncate names to 8.3 format
      Then use gantmake to compile the specification for the package simple_io.ads. gnatmake simple_io
      This of course only needs to be done once.
    * Use gnatchop to split the file into separate package specs and bodies.
      gnatchop -w -r x00_acc2.ada
      If you are using DOS/Win 3.1 then use the -k flag to truncate names to 8.3 format
    * Use gnatmake to compile the various units. The parameter to make is the name of the main procedure.
      gnatmake main
    * You can now run the executable image.
